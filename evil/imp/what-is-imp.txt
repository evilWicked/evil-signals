This one you probably have not seen before. It stands for implementation.

The options for releasing this library was either use CMake or try some form of header
only distribution.

The CMake option is a good one - CMake works amzingly well - but seeing I dont have a 
Mac would leave me releasing code that has only been built on windows.

The examples do use CMake but dont work on anything except windows.

So rather than release a cross platform library that can only run on one platform I 
thought I would take some lessons from the single file STB libraries from Sean Barrett
https://github.com/nothings/stb and release them as a source only program.

The way they are used is that you "horror recoil finger nails on blackboard" 
#include "imp/filename.cpp"  in a source file. 

You can simply include it in a source file with other code. You can if you want 
open a collection of  files each with one line in it (to produce one obj per include) 
or simply open a single empty file with all the files in it. 
The last one is how the demos are built.
