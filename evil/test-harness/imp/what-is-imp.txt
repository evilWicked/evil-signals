This one you probably have not seen before. It stands for implementation.

The options for releasing this library was either use CMake or try some form of header
only distribution.

The CMake option is a good one - CMake works amazingly well - but seeing I dont have a 
Mac would leave me releasing code that has only been built on windows.

The examples do use CMake but dont work on anything except windows.

So rather than release a cross platform library that can only run on one platform I 
thought I would take some lessons from the single file STB libraries from Sean Barrett
https://github.com/nothings/stb and release them as source only.

you should find an evil-wrapper.cpp file in teh top level directory that does 
the work for you simply #include evil/libname/evil-wrapper.cpp somehere in your source
or if you want to break things up #include "/evil/libname/imp/filename.cpp" 
wherever they are needed.
