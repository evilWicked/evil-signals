test contains a simple test harness that enables a bunch of tests
to be run saving the output which it then dumps out in a simple table.

I wanted to avoid tests streaming to cout in the middle of test iterations
which messes out performance tests.  

It is better to save the results and dump out at the end rather than have 
loops waiting for cout.
